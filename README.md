# Web GUI for chess AI visualization

Web app for visualizing the stream of conciousness of a chess machine.

This site is deployed using PythonAnywhere: <a href="http://chessrpjj.pythonanywhere.com/"> "Watch My Chess Moves" </a>

Currently, you can visualize the tree in its board states of a 3-ply vanilla minimax, as the machine iterates through all possibilities and searches for the maximum score assuming the opponent (human input) will attempt to minimize the score.
